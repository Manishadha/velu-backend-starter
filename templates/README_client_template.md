# Your App – Quick Start Guide

Welcome! This folder contains a ready-to-run app generated by **Velu**.

You don’t have to understand Python or JavaScript deeply – just follow the steps below.

---

## 1. What’s inside

- **Backend API** (FastAPI / Python)  
  Folder: `generated/services/api`  
  Runs on: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

- **Web frontend** (Next.js / React)  
  Folder: `generated/web`  
  Runs on: `http://localhost:3001`

- **Extras**
  - `react_spa/` – small React demo app (optional, for developers)
  - `tests/` – automated tests
  - `README.md` / `README_packaged.md` – technical docs (for developers)

You mostly need **Sections 2–4** to see your app running.

---

## 2. Requirements

Install these once on your machine:

- **Python** 3.10 or newer
- **Node.js** 18 or 20 (with `npm`)
- A terminal (macOS Terminal, Windows PowerShell, etc.)

---

## 3. Start the backend (API)

1. Open a terminal and go into this project folder (where this file lives):

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/unzipped/folder

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS / Linux

# On Windows (PowerShell):
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


3. Install the Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Start the backend API:

uvicorn generated.services.api.app:app --reload --port 8000


5. Keep this terminal window open. You should see:

Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
Application startup complete.


Test that it works (optional):

curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health


Expected:

{"ok": true}

## 4. Start the web app (frontend)

Open a second terminal window.

Go to the frontend folder:

cd /path/to/your/unzipped/folder/generated/web


Install JavaScript dependencies:

npm install


Start the development server:

npm run dev -- --port 3001


Open your browser at:

http://localhost:3001


Your web app should now be running and talking to the backend on port 8000.

## 5. Optional: AI & language endpoints

Only if your project was generated with these features.
They are safe to try; if not present, the endpoints will return an error.

5.1 AI chat endpoint
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/ai/chat \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'


Example response:

{"reply": "hello"}

5.2 Locales (i18n) endpoint
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/i18n/locales


Example:

{"locales": ["en"]}


Some projects may include more languages.

## 6. Optional: React SPA demo (developers only)

Some projects include a react_spa/ folder that demonstrates a simple front-end talking to the /v1/i18n/* APIs.

To run it:

Open another terminal window.

Go to the SPA folder:

cd /path/to/your/unzipped/folder/react_spa


Install dependencies:

npm install


Start the SPA:

npm run dev -- --port 5173


Open:

http://localhost:5173


If the backend is running, it will try to use http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/i18n/locales.
If not, it falls back to defaults.

## 7. Stopping everything

To stop the backend: press CTRL + C in the terminal where uvicorn is running.

To stop the frontend / SPA: press CTRL + C in that terminal.

## 8. Sharing this project

You can:

Zip this folder and send it to someone else.

Or push it to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

As long as they follow Sections 2–4, they should be able to run the app locally.
